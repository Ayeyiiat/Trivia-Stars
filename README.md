# Trivia-Stars

Chuck Palahniuk:
> “Trivia is designed to make us feel better about the random, useless facts that are all we have left of our education.”

## Project Description
### We are all about having fun while learning. With our platform, you can play solo trivia rounds while enjoying the engaging page aesthetic and background music. You can also create a multiplayer session by creating a room, giving your unique pin to your friends and asking them to join. Once they join, begin the game and lets see how you work together as a team.
